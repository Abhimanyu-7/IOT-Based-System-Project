# :computer: IOT-Based-System-Project
## :green_circle: Introduction
On __April 8th, 2024__, we took part in the ELC Activity focused on developing an IoT-Based System. This session centered around creating a basic IoT system using the Blynk platform, Arduino IDE, and the ESP32 microcontroller.

-> The main goal was to control an LED and perform various tasks utilizing the **ESP32** and **Blynk** cloud platform.

->This activity offered valuable insights into the __real-world applications__ of IoT and provided __hands-on experience__ in interfacing sensors and actuators with embedded systems.

## :large_blue_circle: Objectives of the Project
The objectives of this activity were:
 - Grasp the fundamental concepts of the __Internet of Things (IoT)__.
 - Learn how to interface various sensors and actuator modules with embedded systems.
 - Design IoT-based applications and analyze their performance.
 - Implement basic IoT applications on an embedded platform.
 - Use simple and readily available electronic sensors/devices to understand the practical applications of IoT by creating a functional circuit (for this activity, we utilized Blynk, Arduino IDE, and ESP32).

These tasks helped us grasp the fundamental principles of IoT systems, such as device-to-cloud communication, sensor interfacing, and real time control. 

The practical applications of these skills are extensive, covering areas like smart home automation, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring systems.

## ðŸŸ  Components used
### :small_blue_diamond: Blynk
Blynk is a comprehensive software suite that enables the prototyping, deployment, and remote management of connected electronic devices at any scale.
Blynk empowers users to :
- connect their hardware to the cloud and create iOS, Android, and web applications
- analyze real-time and historical data from devices
- remotely control them from anywhere, receive important notifications, and much more.
### :small_blue_diamond: ESP32
ESP32 is a low-cost System on Chip (SoC) Microcontroller created by Espressif Systems. It is the successor of the well-known ESP8266. ESP32 not only has Built in WiFi but also has Bluetooth, which made it the ideal microcontroller to use in our ptoject.
### :small_blue_diamond: LDR
A light-dependent resistor is a  passive device whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity and increases with decreasing light intensity. 
LDR was used in the project to control an LED based on the surrounding intensity of light.
### :small_blue_diamond: Arduino IDE
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment is a software tool used to program Arduino boards.

In this project we used Arduino IDE to write and compile our code and further upload it into our hardware. (__i.e__ ESP32 microcontroller)

## :purple_circle: Conclusion
We __successfully__ controlled and blinked an LED __via__ the Blynk cloud service and developed a simple interface where the LED responded to changes in light detected by an LDR sensor.

* In Task 1, we set up a basic LED blinking system controlled through the Blynk app. This task gave us a foundational understanding of connecting an ESP32 to the Blynk cloud, configuring a cloud dashboard system to interact with hardware, and programming the ESP32 for remote control operations.
* Task 2 expanded on this by introducing an LDR sensor to create a light-sensitive LED control system. This task enhanced our understanding of deploying a sensor whose input/output is sent to the board for triggering actions.

#### By the end of the session, we learned about:
 - Controlling interfaced sensors and other modules through the cloud.
 - Various ways to monitor and control IoT-based appliances at home, office, and industry.
 - Developing prototypes to monitor and control applications such as smart home security systems,
 autonomous farming equipment, and industry-oriented applications using mobile phones and cloud repositories.
